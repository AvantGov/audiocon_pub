This is a collection of little parsing functions that I am using to pull from the website enmasse. they are not actually used in the application anywhere. 

You will need to install python and run them locally in order to make use of them. 

### brandsdata 
used to pull links and names from a brick of HTML that was found on the original site. used to reconstruct the brand data base.
